## *AugmentedReality-Realistic Illumination*

The objective of this work is to research how realistic illumination can be achieved in different frameworks using Augmented Reality(AR) technologies. The game engine used for this project is Unity. The main techonologies I researched are: ARCore, ARKit and Vuforia.  With this project I also learned about how tracking types work and different kind of tracking that there are when using this kind of technology.

## *VRBeisbol Game*

This was a personal project in which I explored the possibilities of making a game using a Oculus Quest 2 VR Headset, It was a very fullfilling project in which I modeled and animated all the elements in the scene. The techonlogy used is XR-Foundation.

Here's a short video of some of the tests I recorded when developing the project.
